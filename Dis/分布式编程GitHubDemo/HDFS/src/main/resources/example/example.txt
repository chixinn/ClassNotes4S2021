On the top of the Crumpetty Tree The Quangle Wangle sat,
But his face you could not see, On account of his Beaver Hat.
For his Hat was a hundred and two feet wide,
With ribbons and bibbons on every side
And bells, and buttons, and loops, and lace,
So that nobody ever could see the face Of the Quangle Wangle Quee.
